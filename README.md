Telco & eCommerce Market Research – README

Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive market research analysis of Indonesia’s telecommunications (Telco) sector – focusing on fixed broadband internet – and its eCommerce sector. The research was conducted to understand the current market landscape, competitive dynamics, consumer behavior, and emerging trends in both industries. By examining key data and insights, the project identifies growth opportunities and potential challenges in Indonesia’s booming digital economy. The findings are structured in an easy-to-digest format with visual charts integrated into the discussion to inform business strategy and impress stakeholders with actionable insights.

Indonesia’s internet user base has expanded rapidly, fueling a vibrant eCommerce market and prompting intense competition among broadband providers. Home-grown companies dominate their respective domains – Telkom Indonesia in broadband and Tokopedia/Shopee in eCommerce – yet both sectors are evolving as new players enter and consumer expectations rise. The analysis highlights these developments and provides a snapshot of market conditions and trends, pointing out strategic considerations for businesses operating in or entering these markets.

Market Research Methodology

This market research was conducted using secondary research methods, gathering data from reputable industry reports, surveys, and market analyses covering roughly 2017 through 2023. Data points such as internet penetration rates, subscriber numbers, eCommerce traffic, and sales volumes were collected and compared to extract key insights.

Data from multiple sources was triangulated to ensure accuracy, and all findings were distilled into thematic insights for both Telco and eCommerce sectors. Visual charts have been integrated throughout the discussion to clearly illustrate trends such as the rapid growth of internet users, the market share of leading broadband providers, and the competitive dynamics among eCommerce platforms.

Findings & Insights

Telco Industry Insights (Broadband & Internet)

Indonesia has one of the world’s largest internet user bases. By mid-2019, it ranked among the top countries globally in the number of internet users. However, while mobile data usage is widespread, fixed broadband penetration remains low. In 2018, fixed broadband subscriptions were only a small fraction of the population, growing to an estimated 11–13 million users by 2023.

The fixed broadband market is dominated by a few key players. Telkom Indonesia’s IndiHome is the clear market leader, commanding a significant share compared to competitors like First Media and CBN. The competitive landscape is characterized by differentiation in pricing and target segments. IndiHome offers a broad portfolio from entry-level to premium packages, while competitors tend to focus either on premium high-end services or value-driven basic plans.

Price competition is evident, but providers also differentiate by bundling services like cable TV, streaming subscriptions, and faster speed tiers to attract various customer segments. Emerging mobile operators, such as XL Axiata and Indosat Ooredoo, are also entering the home broadband space, leveraging their large mobile customer base to offer fixed-wireless solutions. This convergence intensifies competition, requiring traditional ISPs to innovate and defend their market share.

Increasing demand for data, driven by trends such as video streaming and online gaming, has also influenced telco strategies. For example, shifts in content consumption prompted adjustments in policies regarding streaming services. Government and private investments in infrastructure (like extensive fiber networks) are gradually bridging the digital divide, though challenges remain in reaching remote areas.

eCommerce Market Insights

Indonesia’s eCommerce sector is one of the largest and fastest-growing in Southeast Asia. By 2019, a significant majority of internet users had engaged in online shopping. The market is dominated by three major platforms – Tokopedia, Shopee, and Bukalapak – which together account for the majority of web traffic and transaction value.

In terms of transaction value, Tokopedia leads with the highest share, followed by Shopee and then Bukalapak. This indicates that while Tokopedia may have slightly better monetization or a higher-value basket per transaction, Shopee’s rapid rise in popularity is noteworthy.

Customer preferences in Indonesia heavily emphasize cost savings and convenience. Free shipping, low prices, and attractive promotions are the top factors driving consumers to choose one platform over another. Ease of use and secure payment methods also play crucial roles. These insights are supported by visuals that compare key customer preferences and show the impact of promotional strategies on user behavior.

The competitive strategies of the major platforms differ:

Tokopedia focuses on building a trusted local brand with strong ties to small and medium enterprises, using campaigns that emphasize local success stories.
Shopee competes aggressively with heavy promotions, flash sales, and in-app rewards that create a gamified shopping experience.
Bukalapak distinguishes itself by diversifying services, including fintech and digital payments, while penetrating underserved markets with localized initiatives.
Emerging trends also include an increase in digital payments, driven by fintech innovations that reduce friction in online transactions. The integration of e-wallets has made it easier for even unbanked consumers to participate in eCommerce. Additionally, there is potential for further market expansion as internet penetration continues to rise, particularly in rural and tier-2 cities.
